Project Title: Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Tool

Description:
The Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Tool is a Python program that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

Features:

Encryption: Users can input a message and specify a shift value (an integer) to perform encryption. The program then shifts each letter in the message by the specified number of positions in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary, and returns the encrypted message.
Decryption: Users can input an encrypted message and the corresponding shift value used for encryption to decrypt the message. The program reverses the encryption process by shifting each letter in the encrypted message in the opposite direction to reveal the original plaintext message.
Input Validation: The program validates user inputs to ensure that the entered message contains only alphabetic characters and that the shift value is an integer.
User-Friendly Interface: The program provides a simple command-line interface (CLI) where users can interactively choose between encryption and decryption, enter messages, and specify shift values.
Case Preservation: The program preserves the case of letters in the input message during encryption and decryption. Uppercase letters are encrypted to uppercase letters, and lowercase letters to lowercase letters.
Error Handling: The program handles invalid user inputs gracefully and provides informative error messages to guide users on correct usage.
Usage:

Run the program.
Choose between encryption ('E') and decryption ('D').
Enter the message to encrypt or decrypt.
Specify the shift value (an integer).
The program displays the encrypted or decrypted message accordingly.
Benefits:

Provides a simple and intuitive tool for users to secure their messages using a classic encryption technique.
Helps users understand the basics of encryption and cryptography through hands-on experience with the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
Can be used for educational purposes to demonstrate encryption and decryption processes in programming.
Future Enhancements:

Implement support for additional encryption algorithms for comparative analysis.
Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive user experience.
Enhance error handling and input validation to cover edge cases.
Add functionality for automatic brute-force decryption to find the correct shift value.
Incorporate file I/O capabilities to encrypt and decrypt text files.
